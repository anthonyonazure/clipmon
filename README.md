# clipmon

Clipboard mega-manager for Mac (stable), Windows and Linux that can sync with Android and iOS

Built for pros (developers, writers, designers… basically anyone), this app gives you a fast, searchable history with rich previews, Markdown support, and a clean macOS menu bar experience.

Most clipboard managers feel like a dump of text. This one treats your clipboard like a workspace.

- Understands what you copy  
- Shows previews, not just raw data  
- Fast, keyboard-first workflow  
- Lives quietly in your macOS menu bar
